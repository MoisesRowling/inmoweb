/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Prototyping.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset grants open read and write access to all data in the Firestore database.
 * This is intended for rapid prototyping and should NEVER be used in a production environment.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The database consists of top-level collections for 'Users', 'Properties', 'Investments', and 'Transactions'.
 * Each document within these collections is identified by a unique ID.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - All reads and writes are allowed for any user, authenticated or not.
 * - No data validation is performed.
 *
 * WARNING: These rules are insecure and should only be used for local development and prototyping.
